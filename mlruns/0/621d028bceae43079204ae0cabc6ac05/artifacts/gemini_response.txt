I do not have access to real-time information, including court records or legal databases.  Therefore, I cannot provide specific details about Kapil Sibal's involvement in any cases related to "Waqt Board 2025."  To find this information, you would need to:

* **Search legal databases:**  LexisNexis, Westlaw, and other legal databases (often subscription-based) contain detailed case information, including lawyer participation.
* **Search news archives:** Major news outlets may have reported on any significant cases where Kapil Sibal was involved. Search using keywords like "Kapil Sibal," "Waqt Board," and "2025."
* **Check Kapil Sibal's website or law firm's website:**  His professional website might list some of his notable cases.

Keep in mind that "Waqt Board 2025" is a rather vague term.  If you can provide more specific details about the nature of the board or the case itself (e.g., location, subject matter, involved parties), it will significantly improve the chances of finding relevant information.
