I cannot directly access external websites or specific databases like LexisNexis.  Therefore, I cannot provide you with information on Kapil Sibal's involvement in any "Waqt Board 2025" cases.

To find this information, you will need to:

1. **Access LexisNexis:**  You'll need a subscription or access through a law library to use LexisNexis.
2. **Search LexisNexis:** Use relevant keywords such as "Kapil Sibal," "Waqt Board," and "2025."  You may need to experiment with different search terms and filters to refine your results.  Consider adding any other details you might know about the case (e.g., location, type of law involved).

Remember that legal databases require precise search strategies to yield accurate results.  If you have trouble finding the information, consider refining your search terms or seeking assistance from a legal professional or librarian familiar with LexisNexis.
