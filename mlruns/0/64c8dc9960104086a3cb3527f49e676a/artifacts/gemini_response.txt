I need more information to answer your query.  "Waqt Board" isn't a readily identifiable legal or political entity.  To find relevant cases involving Kapil Sibal and whatever "Waqt Board" refers to, I need more context.  For example:

* **What is "Waqt Board"?** Is it a specific organization, a court, a news program, or something else?  Providing the full name or a more descriptive term would be helpful.
* **What kind of cases are you interested in?**  Are you looking for cases where Kapil Sibal was a lawyer, a witness, or a party involved?  What is the subject matter of the cases (e.g., constitutional law, corporate law, criminal law)?
* **What time period are you interested in?**  Specifying a date range will narrow down the search.

With more information, I can try to locate relevant information.
