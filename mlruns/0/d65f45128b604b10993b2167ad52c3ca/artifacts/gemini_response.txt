Section 370 of the Indian Constitution was a temporary provision that granted special autonomous status to the state of Jammu and Kashmir.  It was repealed by the Indian government in August 2019.

Before its repeal, Section 370 allowed Jammu and Kashmir to have its own constitution, flag, and limited autonomy in matters of law and order.  It also meant that only Indian citizens who were permanent residents of Jammu and Kashmir could buy property there, and that laws passed by the Indian Parliament did not automatically apply to the state without the state legislature's assent.

The repeal of Section 370 removed these special provisions, integrating Jammu and Kashmir more fully into the Indian Union.  This was a highly controversial decision, with supporters arguing it promoted national unity and integration, and opponents arguing it violated the rights of the Kashmiri people and undermined the region's unique cultural identity.  The consequences of the repeal are still being debated and analyzed.
