Article 370 of the Indian Constitution was a temporary provision that granted special autonomous status to the state of Jammu and Kashmir.  It was enacted in 1947, shortly after India's independence, and allowed Jammu and Kashmir to have its own constitution, flag, and a degree of self-governance.  Crucially, it limited the Indian Parliament's power to make laws for the state, except in specified areas like defense, foreign affairs, and communications.  Residents of Jammu and Kashmir also did not automatically have the same rights as other Indian citizens.

The key features of Article 370 included:

* **Separate Constitution:** Jammu and Kashmir had its own constitution, distinct from the Indian Constitution.
* **Limited Application of Indian Laws:** Many Indian laws did not automatically apply to Jammu and Kashmir.  The state's legislature had the power to decide which laws to adopt.
* **Special Status for Permanent Residents:**  Only "permanent residents" of Jammu and Kashmir had certain rights, including the right to own land and vote.  This provision largely excluded non-residents from acquiring property and holding certain government jobs.

On August 5, 2019, the Indian government revoked Article 370, effectively ending the special status of Jammu and Kashmir.  The move was highly controversial, with supporters arguing it would promote integration and development, while opponents claimed it violated the rights of the Kashmiri people and undermined the region's unique identity. The revocation led to significant political and social unrest in the region, and continues to be a subject of ongoing debate and legal challenges.  The legality of the revocation remains a contested point, and several legal challenges have been filed in the Indian Supreme Court, though these are yet to be definitively resolved.
