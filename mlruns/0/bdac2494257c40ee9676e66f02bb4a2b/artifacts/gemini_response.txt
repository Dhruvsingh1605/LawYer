There haven't been any *Supreme Court of India* cases directly *based* on Section 370 in recent times that have generated significant public attention or detailed reporting.  The revocation of Article 370 in 2019 led to several petitions challenging its legality, and while some cases remain ongoing in the Supreme Court, there hasn't been a major ruling or significant development recently that would constitute "latest" news.

To get precise details, you'd need to specify:

* **What constitutes "latest" for you?**  Are you looking for cases filed in the last month, year, or since the revocation?
* **What kind of details are you seeking?**  Are you interested in the case name, petitioners, respondents, arguments presented, the court's order, or the legal analysis?


Without this additional information, a comprehensive answer is impossible.  You might have better luck searching the Supreme Court of India's website directly or using legal databases like Manupatra or SCC Online to find specific cases related to Article 370 and their current status.
