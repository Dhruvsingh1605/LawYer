Please provide me with the context of "section 133".  Section 133 exists in many different legal codes and statutes around the world.  To tell you something about it, I need to know which legal code or statute you're referring to (e.g., Section 133 of the Indian Evidence Act, Section 133 of the California Penal Code, etc.).  Once you provide the relevant legal code, I can give you information about that specific section.
