I do not have access to real-time information, including breaking news or specific comments made on online forums like "Waqt Board."  To find Kapil Sibal's latest comments on that platform, you will need to:

* **Search the Waqt Board directly:** Go to the Waqt Board website and use their search function to look for posts or comments by or about Kapil Sibal.  The specific search terms you use will depend on the topic you are interested in.

* **Use a web search engine:**  Try a search like "Kapil Sibal Waqt Board latest comments" on Google, Bing, or another search engine.  This may surface relevant articles or forum threads.

* **Check news sources:** Major Indian news outlets often report on prominent figures like Kapil Sibal's statements.  Checking their websites or apps might reveal if they've reported on recent comments he made, even if not specifically referencing the Waqt Board.


Keep in mind that information found online, particularly on forums, should be critically evaluated for accuracy and reliability.
