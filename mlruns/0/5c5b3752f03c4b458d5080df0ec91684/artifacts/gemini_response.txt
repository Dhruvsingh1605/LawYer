There is no known established entity or product called a "Waqt Board."  It's possible this is:

* **A misspelling:**  Could you be thinking of a similar-sounding name?  Perhaps a whiteboard, Kanban board, or a specific scheduling/planning tool?
* **A niche product or internal tool:** It might be a board used within a specific company or organization, not publicly known.
* **A newly created product:**  The name might be very new and hasn't yet gained online visibility.
* **A misunderstanding:**  The term might be used informally or in a specific context that isn't clear.


To help me understand what you're looking for, please provide more context. For example:

* **Where did you hear about the "Waqt Board"?** (Website, article, conversation, etc.)
* **What is its purpose?** (Scheduling, project management, etc.)
* **Any other details you can remember?** (Appearance, features, etc.)


With more information, I can try to provide a more accurate answer.
