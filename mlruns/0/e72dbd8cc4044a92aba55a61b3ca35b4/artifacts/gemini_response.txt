The final result of the Johnny Depp and Amber Heard defamation trial was a partial victory for both sides.  The jury found that Heard defamed Depp in her 2018 Washington Post op-ed, awarding him $10 million in compensatory damages and $5 million in punitive damages (later reduced to $350,000 due to a Virginia state cap on punitive damages).  Simultaneously, the jury found that Depp, through his lawyer, defamed Heard, awarding her $2 million in compensatory damages.  Therefore, Depp received a net amount of approximately $8.35 million after accounting for Heard's counter-claim award.  The divorce itself was finalized in 2017, well before this defamation trial.  The defamation trial was a separate proceeding focusing solely on the claims of defamation made by each party against the other.
