There aren't specific "laws for women" in the same way there are laws about, say, driving or taxation.  Laws apply to everyone, regardless of gender, although some laws disproportionately affect women or address issues specifically impacting women.  To give you a helpful answer, I need more specifics.  What area of law are you interested in?  For example, are you looking for laws related to:

* **Employment:** Equal pay, maternity leave, sexual harassment, discrimination
* **Healthcare:** Reproductive rights, access to healthcare, domestic violence
* **Education:** Title IX (prohibits sex-based discrimination in schools)
* **Family Law:** Marriage, divorce, child custody, alimony, domestic violence
* **Criminal Justice:**  Sentencing disparities, victim protection, sexual assault laws
* **Property Rights:** Inheritance, ownership

Please specify the area of law you're interested in, and I can provide a more relevant and helpful response.  I can also provide information on landmark cases within those areas if you wish.
